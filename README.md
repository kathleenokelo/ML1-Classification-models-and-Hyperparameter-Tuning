# Classification Models & Hyperparameter Tuning

## Project Overview
This project focuses on building and evaluating **classification models** to predict the target class using labeled data. The aim is to explore different classification algorithms and improve their performance through **hyperparameter tuning**.

## Classification Models
You can experiment with various classification algorithms, such as:
- **Logistic Regression**
- **Decision Trees**
- **Random Forest**
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
- **Ensemble Methods (e.g., Boosting,Bagging, Voting, Stacking)**

## Hyperparameter Tuning
Hyperparameters are model-specific settings that can be fine-tuned to improve performance. Some common hyperparameters to tune include:
- **Learning rate**
- **Tree depth** (for tree-based models)
- **Regularization parameters** (for Logistic Regression, SVM)
- **Number of estimators** (for ensemble models)

### Tuning Methods
- **Grid Search**: Searches exhaustively through a manually specified subset of hyperparameters.
- **Random Search**: Randomly searches through hyperparameter combinations for faster results.
- **Bayesian Optimization**: Uses probabilistic models to choose the best hyperparameter settings efficiently.

## Evaluation
Models can be evaluated using metrics such as:
- **Accuracy**
- **Precision**
- **Recall**
- **F1-Score**
